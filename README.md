# Core-model-overflow-metabolism
The Mathematica notebooks and Excel files listed below contain data and code that are used for numerical implementations of the core model. These implementations create figures in the preprint "Maarten J. Droste, Robert Planqu√©, Frank J. Bruggeman - On the conditions for overflow metabolism".

- **Yeast core model.nb**: Mathematica code for implementation of the core model for the yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. Used to create Figures 5, S2, S3, S6, S7 and compute proteome efficiencies.
- **Yeast core model for total ATP demand.nb**: Mathematica code for implementation of the core model for the yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ with the Total ATP demand. Used to create Figure S4 and compute proteome efficiencies.
- **Yeast core model for constant saturations.nb**: Mathematica code for implementation of the core model for the yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_, using constant saturation factors. Used to create Figure S5.
- **Illustration for nutrient quality.nb**: Mathematica code for a numerical illustration of the results for carbon-limited batch growth. Used to create Figure 6.

- **Copy of Figure1_data from Elsemman (2022).xlsx**: Copy of file from Elsemman et al. (2022, Nature Communications) containing efflux and biomass yield data. This data is plotted (with permission) in Figures 5, S3, S4, S5.
- **Data for saturation functions.xlsx**: Contains processed data from Elsemman et al. (2022, Nature Communications) to derive the saturation functions and mean kcats per sector that are used in the core model for the yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. This data is plotted (with permission) in Figure S2.
- **Proteomics data for sector protein fractions.xlsx**: Contains processed proteomics data from Elsemman et al. (2022, Nature Communications) to compute the protein fractions per sector that are used in the core model for the yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. This data is plotted (with permission) in Figures 5, S5.
